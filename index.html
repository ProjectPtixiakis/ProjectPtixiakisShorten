    <p>
      Long, complex URLs can be difficult to read, remember, and share. URL shortening transforms
      bulky links into clean, compact versions that are easier to use across social media,
      messaging apps, and marketing campaigns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shortened URLs are especially powerful on platforms with character limits, such as X,
      where every character matters. They also improve visual appeal, increase click-through
      rates, and help maintain consistent branding when custom domains are used.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond convenience, many URL shorteners provide analytics like click counts, geographic
      data, and referral sources. This makes shortened links not just simpler, but smarter—giving
      you insight into how and where your content is being shared.
